## What Is EdTeach?
EdTeach: Teachers is a mock learning management app (like Canvas or Blackboard). The teachers portal is meant to allow educators to build and store lesson plans, dividing individual courses into Modules, Lessons, and Topics. These are comprised of Widgets, allowing for flexibility of functionality. These are stored on an external server (https://github.com/whysgai/EdTeach_Server_Java).  

## What technology is used in the EdTeach client?
The front-end of EdTeach Is built in React.js/Redux, with styling predominantly provided with Bootstrap.

## What's with the name?
Etymology: Blackboard (the software) -> Blackbeard (the pirate) a.k.a Edward Teach -> EdTeach

## When and why was EdTeach created?
EdTeach was built over the fall of 2020 for the Web Development course of my MSCS program at Northeastern University

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
